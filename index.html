      <p>I wrote journal entries for 82 days, from March 11th when we began quarantine until June 1st when I was finally able to go back to work. I did these partly out of boredom, partly because I wanted to see how much would change in this span of time. Reflecting back on this time has been good for the soul. I learned so much about myself and was able to really stop and see the beauty of the world around me, something I did not do enough of in all the busyness. 2020 has been trying, but honestly, I would not change a thing. I hope this does not come across as shallow or offensive to anyone. I know that covid has brought hardship to so many lives and I realize others have been through much more pain than I have. I certainly do not want to overlook that. I hope you enjoy this window into my life.</p>
